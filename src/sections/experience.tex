    \cvItem Implemented a lexical and syntax analyzer (parser) for a subset of
      C programming language using the flex/bison library, which produces an
      abstract syntax tree (AST) of the source code. Also implemented a semantic
      analyzer for the language.

    \cvItem Developed an application that simulates a two-way set associative
      caches with the least recently used (LRU) replacement policy.

    \cvItem Implemented a multi-threaded merge-sort algorithm in Java, and it
      works faster in almost all x86-64 based computers than the single-threaded
      one, since all devided parts of input list are sorted in parallel threads.

    \cvItem Implemented the classic producer-consumer pattern with a few
      additional conditions using POSIX threads.

    \cvItem Worked on several course projects related to Cryptography, Parallel
      Programming, and Object Oriented Programming in C++.
